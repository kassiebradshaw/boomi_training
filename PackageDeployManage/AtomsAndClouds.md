## Local Atom vs. Cloud Atom

* **Local atom** can get access to all resources whether they be:
  * On-premise to on-premise behind a firewall
  * On-premise to cloud, or cloud to on-premise
  * Cloud to cloud

* **Cloud atom** can get access to:
  * Resources solely in the cloud
    * Never need to directly connect to resources behind a firewall
