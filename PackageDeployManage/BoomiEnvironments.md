# Boomi Environments

*Notes taken*: 07-14-2021

## Objectives

* Attach an Atom to an environment

---

* Accesible via Management -> Atom Management
* Environment is the container which contains the Atom and the deployed processes
* An Atom can only be assigned to one Environment at a time

* Think of environments as a dedicated deployment setup used to support the different integration development life-cycle phases
* Within environments, we'll attach a specific Atom to controll the process run-time
